## back in blackout (java - OOP)
In this game, I architected a system for satellite-based file transfers, employing an OOP approach. I integrated key concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance to facilitate seamless file uploads, downloads, and transfers between satellites and devices. This design effectively demonstrated the application of Object-Oriented principles in creating a functional, non-trivial satellite communication system.

## dungeonmania (java - OOP)
Implementation of Dungeonmania board game. Built off existing monolith repository. Executed OOP design patterns.

## link state routing protocal (python - OOP)
Implemented the link state routing protocal across a network of routers. My program, operational on each router, received inputs identifying neighboring routers and the costs associated with linking to them. A key function of the program was to enable each router to broadcast link-state packets to every other router in the network. The primary objective was to calculate and display the most efficient path, along with its associated cost, to all other routers in the network from each router. Additionally, my program was designed to effectively manage and adapt to scenarios involving router failures.
